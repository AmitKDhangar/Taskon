## 💡 Why I Built This

We all need a way to manage our day – sticky notes get lost, and spreadsheets are overkill. I wanted to create a small, fast, and customizable app that feels like a productivity buddy instead of a complicated tool.

Plus, I used it as an excuse to sharpen my TypeScript skills and write clean, scalable front-end code — something every developer should practice.
